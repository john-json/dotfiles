### [ü§î Why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTDeEJyCmNA&t=39s)

Initially, it was an automatic (CronJob) playlist archiving tool for "New Music Friday" playlists from popular EDM labels.
It allowed me to compensate for FOMO when I didn't have time to discover new music right away.

Over time, I developed the desire to rewrite the otherwise lifelong beta (~~never touch a running system~~)
and sprinkle some structured overhead on top ;-)

composer create-project stevenfoncken/multitool-for-spotify-php
```

or

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/stevenfoncken/multitool-for-spotify-php.git
```

```

---

### Config

#### .env

```shell
cp config/.env.dist config/.env
```

Set your timezone in `APP_TIMEZONE` - [List of Supported Timezones](https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php).

```
SPOTIFY_API_CLIENT_ID="2c914ba76f18385qu4b57qr82o5p1e64"
SPOTIFY_API_CLIENT_SECRET="15g2fh52qg1631j1hex4sg167164c1a6"

### Usage

#### Playlist Archiving

```shell
php bin/console mtfsp:archive [--mail] <playlistIDsOrCSV>
```

Each playlist has a snapshot ID that is written to the description of the archived playlist to check whether the playlist has already been archived.

A new archive playlist is only created if the content (so the snapshot ID) has been changed.

Example of the name of an generated archive playlist: SFY-2024-06-Top 50 Global
(PREFIX-YYYY-WW-SUFFIX or PLAYLIST_NAME)

You can choose between single playlist IDs or a path to a CSV file as an argument:

**Argument playlist ID:**

Single or comma-separated spotify playlist ID(s).

**Argument CSV file path:**

| CSV header           | Description                                                                                                     | Required |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Playlist_Name_Prefix | Custom abbreviation e.g. SFY for spotify playlists. Uses ARCHIVE when not set.                                  | No       |
| Playlist_Name_Suffix | Custom playlist name. Uses the playlist name when not set.                                                      | No       |
| Playlist_Sort_Order  | desc => recent added tracks at top, asc => oldest added tracks at top. Uses playlist default oder when not set. | No       |
| Playlist_Id          | The ID of the spotify playlist.                                                                                 | Yes      |
| Tags                 | For personal use.                                                                                               | No       |

The CSV must be separated by semicolons. Example: [playlists-to-archive.dist.csv](config/playlists-to-archive.dist.csv)

**Option for mailing:**

If you set the mail env vars in your [.env](config/.env) file,
you can use `--mail` to receive notifications when the archiving process is complete.

This is particularly useful when using a CronJob.

---

#### List Archived Playlists

```shell
php bin/console mtfsp:archive:list-playlists
```

---

#### Delete Archived Playlists

```shell
php bin/console mtfsp:archive:delete-playlists
```

Currently all archived playlists will be deleted.
But multiple "are you sure" checks will protect you from hasty mistakes ;-)

---

#### Create Artist Catalog Playlist

```shell
php bin/console mtfsp:artist:catalog-to-playlist <artistId> [<playlistId>]
```

If you specify a playlist ID, the catalog will be added to this playlist, otherwise a new playlist will be created.

---

#### Search Library Playlists for a Given Track

```shell
php bin/console mtfsp:search:track-in-library [--withArchived] <trackIdNeedle>
```

Set `--withArchived` if you want to include archived playlists in the search.
